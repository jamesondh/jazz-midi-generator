# Development status

Data fetching and corpus parsing have been implemented (section 1 of the plan).\
This includes iRealPro chord extraction and a basic MIDI solo event parser.\
Chord Markov training and progression sampling are now functional (`train_chord_markov.py` and `markov_chords.py`).

## Next steps

- Continue with melody/rhythm modules and CLI as outlined in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
